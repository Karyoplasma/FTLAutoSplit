# FTLAutoSplit
Very simple autosplitter for FTL: Faster Than Light. Probably only works on the lastest version with AE.

Starts at first beacon, splits at the start of a new sector and after flagship is defeated.

Known bug: If you die during the run, the splitter will just act as if you defeated the flagship. Probably an easy fix, but I cannot be bothered to search for the offset for the victory flag.
